        <p> "Before the program, I expected to receive messages often regarding my consistency and progress. 
            You met and exceeded them by constantly encouraging me and giving advice when I felt that I was in a rut.
             In addition to my fitness, the program improved my confidence levels and my sense of control I have over 
            my life. I loved the workout plan/ meal plan I received. Some of the exercises I was not used to, and it
            was great to see my weights increase each week with the various exercises.  I definitely feel more 
            knowledgeable about nutrition and fitness, and I’m excited to see where I go from here."</p>

        <p id="pad">"Cole’s program was simple and smart. It felt like magic. Really, he did not just help me improve my fitness
            performance and results, but also, following his plan changed many more aspects of my life for the better. 
            Due to the genius meals, I felt so much energized that I was able to upgrade my focus - not only Inside 
            the gym but also at school and friends/family. Getting stronger and being properly nourished at the 
            same time gave my days a boost of happiness and confidence.  Above all, what makes Cole a special 
            trainer is his support throughout the process, and the great advice he’s able to give. Hands down 
            to this amazing human and vegan trainer :)"</p>

        <p id="pad"> "Cole was able to exceed my expectations of this program by just being in contact. I feel with a lot of the big companies and industries that have workout and nutrition programs they give you “everything you need to succeed” but then do not check up or take a general interest in their customers. I thought Cole did a phenomenal job with this aspect which totally made the experience worth it. Gaining muscle was always very difficult for me. I have been a twig my whole life and just this past year I really tried to transform the way I dieted and worked out. Of course I saw results when I was doing it on my own for 6 months but none like the ones I saw when working with Cole’s 6 week program. My mission was to bulk and he made it extremely easy for me to understand the ratio of carbs, fats and proteins I needed daily plus the amount of calories I needed to intake per day. I was able to stay lean, gain 6 lbs in 6 weeks and feel the strongest I have ever felt in my life. I started to see muscles that I have never seen before and that was a great feeling to be able to work so hard for those lasting results."</p>
